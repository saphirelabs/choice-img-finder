## Introduction

This React application allows users to view and interact with generative images created by the "Choice" interactive sculpture. Users can save and print images after subscribing. In the future, this functionality can be enhanced to enable minting (on-chain) the generative images as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain using web3 wallets. The app fetches image data from a backend endpoint and provides a seamless user experience with various functionalities such as subscription, validation, and image operations.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saphirelabs/choice-img-finder.git

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following environment variables:

```env

These environment variables define the base URLs for the backend API. Ensure these are correctly set to avoid exposing sensitive data.

```

Ensure these environment variables are set correctly to point to your backend API.

## Global Styles

Global styles are defined using `createGlobalStyle` from `styled-components`:

```javascript
import { createGlobalStyle } from "styled-components";

export const GlobalStyle = createGlobalStyle`
    * {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        box-sizing: border-box;
    }

    html, body {
        font-size: 1rem;
        font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
    }
`;
```

These global styles ensure a consistent baseline for styling across the application.
